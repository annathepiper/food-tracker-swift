# food-tracker-swift
My practice repo for working through Apple's "Food Tracker" tutorial on the Apple Developer site. This repo includes both the code that results from the tutorial AND a bunch of practice UI tests I wrote for it.

As of May 2019 I was hired for a new position which required me to be able to test in an iOS app environment. I had no prior experience with this; all my prior testing work had been in the context of websites, not apps. So I decided it'd be appropriate to get familiar with XCode and the Swift language, to see how an iOS app is built--and to therefore be able to test it.

I'm archiving the work here since none of it is working with proprietary data or anything specifically related to my job's actual work. Also, I wanted to be able to have this for later reference to be able to demonstrate work I've done with XCode and Swift.

## Prerequisites
I created this code on a MacBook Pro running Mojave 10.14.5, with XCode 10.2.1 and Swift 5.

The tutorial I followed to create this project is the Apple tutorial [here](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/referencelibrary/GettingStarted/DevelopiOSAppsSwift/).

Most of the project is just a straightforward implementation of the tutorial. I'll describe the parts that aren't part of the tutorial below.

## Skills and tech I'm demonstrating here
* Implementing a simple app in XCode
* Adding CocoaPods to a project
* Adding UI Tests to an XCode project

## Running the code yourself
Since this is an XCode project, you will need a Mac running XCode to run it yourself. You can install XCode via the Mac App Store.
